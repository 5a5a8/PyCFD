# 12 Steps to Navier Stokes

## Note:

Github sometimes has trouble rendering Jupyter notebooks.
Your best bet is to clone this repository and run the notebooks locally.

If that is not an option, try pasting the link at [https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). 
Note that this should work, but may take a while to render the animations.

## Introduction

These are the Jupyter notebooks I created while completing the course '12 Steps to Navier Stokes' by Lorena A. Barber.
This is a work in progress, not all steps have been completed yet.
I will complete them over the coming weeks as time becomes available.

The course is an entry-level course in computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
You will probably want to be comfortable with partial differential equations and regular (non-computational) fluid dynamics before starting.

Steps 1 to 4 are in one spacial dimension.
Steps 5 to 10 are in two spacial dimensions.
Steps 11 and 12 solve the Navier-Stokes equation in 2D.

You can read about the Navier-Stokes equations on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations)

## Animations

At the end, I will put some of my favourite animations from the course here as .gif files.
For now, the animations can be viewed by downloading the Jupyter notebook and running it locally.
Probably, the animations will not display in Github.

Thank you to [Angel Ortiz](https://github.com/Angelo1211) for providing the animation code which I adapted here for my purposes.
